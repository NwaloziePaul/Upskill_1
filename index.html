        I'm an undergraduate currently pursuing a degree in library and information science at university of Nigeria, Nsukka. I am passionate about Information technology, special libraries, cultural heritage management e.t.c. and I am actively involved in activities like acquisition, weeding, and cataloguing of materials that are used in the library.

    <h3>My expectation from the Upskill '24 program</h3>
    <p>
        This program happens to be my first online class and also my first class on web development. I'm looking forward to learning as much as possible on the frontend part of web dev and backend if possible. I really hope that on completion of this program, I'll becoeme a confident programmer and be able to make a living out of it. I look forward to learning and growing together with my fellow students.
